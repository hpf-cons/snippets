Showcase and implementation: Easily patch systems without the need to rely on any
out-of-control 3rd-party pseudo-automation framework, until an Ansible scheduler
and/or a sophisticated config+systems management solution is in-place.*

commit here, we just... submitted the code then :-)

\* (Think Foreman plus Ansible _and_ plus OpenVox (formerly Puppet).)

Showcase and implementation: Easily patch systems without the need to rely on any
out-of-control 3rd-party pseudo-automation framework, until an Ansible scheduler
and/or a sophisticated config+systems management solution is in-place.[^1]

This script has already been working and implemented for weeks before the initial
commit here, we just... submitted the code then :-)

For an Ansible-only playbook showcase, visit [the author's git](https://git.lirion.de/os-patch/tree/).

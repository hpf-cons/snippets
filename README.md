# About

This contains code I use at least somewhere, and that has not been integrated into other repositories
yet.

Once things are migrated to repositories (company-specific, or my public dotfiles repository, or ...),
the code "snippets" will be removed again.

I am not using the GH/GL/... snippets functionality because a repository allows for more control.
